@brief Plugin metadata

This class stores metadata about particular plugin. The plugin metadata are
stored in plugin configuration file, which resides either besides the dynamic
plugin binary in a filesystem or is compiled directly into executable with an
static plugin. See @ref plugin-management for tutorial and brief introduction
into how plugins work.

The plugin configuration file has an simple syntax (see @ref Utility::Configuration
class documentation for full specification). The file stores list of
dependencies (if the plugin depends on another), list of replaced plugins (if
the plugin can replace plugin and provide the same or better functionality) and
optionally plugin-specific configuration. Example `Matrix.conf` file for
`Matrix` plugin:

    # Dependencies
    depends=SomeRandomJohnDoesPlugin
    depends=BaseMatrixPlugin
    depends=SkyNetPlugin

    # Replaced plugins
    replaces=CrashingMatrixPlugin
    replaces=AlphaMatrixPlugin

    # Optional plugin-specific data
    [data]
    description=My first matrix without bugs
